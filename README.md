# CoordinatorPattern-Example
A free basic app based on the Coordinator pattern in Swift (iOS). ViewController transitions from anywhere in your app!

It is a basic setup of the Coordinator pattern and I used some different techniques to transition to another ViewController.
It is all very basic and perhaps only the closure part is some getting used to...but you do not have to use that of course. There is not one solution... just use the pattern in a way you like and choose which transitions you like to copy and delete the rest.

# Installation
Just download the app and view the code and I hope you learn from it. It gives some debug results when data is injected but mainly use it to watch the code.
